## How would I improve this app with coworkers?

This app could be greatly improved with a database, using models for the heroes with Mongoose, for example.
Additionally, we could add images to the heroes.
Each hero could have its own unique URL to explain the details of each one.
We could also add a button to delete any of them from the list and another to edit them.

## If I had more time

I would give the frontend a style boost using Tailwind CSS. I'd also incorporate Jest testing, which unfortunately didn't make the cut this time around.
